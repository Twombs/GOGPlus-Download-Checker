(v1.1) Added support for accepting 7Z and RAR files. Other options added to the Console window for dialog, beep and 'results.txt' files. File size is now shown in the Console. Bugfix for Edit.

(v1.2) Added support for RAR files (a Bugfix really), by requiring the free UnRAR program. Any BZ2 files are now supported (using 7-Zip). PDF files are now supported if the free QPDF program found. Bugfix for the file extension (is now included) in the '- results.txt' file name. Several more options now available on the Console window, including the ability to disable or enable what file type gets checked. The 'Results' folder name can now be '_Results', for those like me, who want it sorted to start of folder view. The Console window will now stay open if a testing error occurs, if that option is enabled ... this includes any files skipped, due to that file type being added to the list, but the program for them not enabled or found. Other minor bugfixes or changes. Content of ZIP files (ZIP, 7Z, BZ2, SH) can now be optionally listed in the 'results.txt' files.

(v1.3) Some minor reporting changes and cosmetic improvements.

(v1.4) Support added for PK4 files, using 7-Zip.

(v1.5) Name change to reflect the program's use beyond GOG only downloads.

(v1.6) Very minor improvement, which was just to the files supported error dialog.

(v1.7) GZ files now supported. Added the recognition of a line in the batch list starting with the word - stop, which the program will stop checking at. NOTE - This means the ability to have only a portion of the list processed, stopping at a pre-determined location or point. This is a handy option with a large list or before large files that take a long time to process. It essentially means you can load a list, and process it in segments. IMPORTANT - To use multiple 'stop' lines in the list, then each must be unique, like having a trailing number or any text really (i.e. stop 1 or stop 2 or stop here etc). The LIST button on the dropbox has an extra right-click option to get the program to create a 'stop' entry for you, with a trailing timestamp to make it unique.
