# GOGPlus-Download-Checker
(formerly GOGDownload-Checker)

![gogplus_drop](https://github.com/Twombs/GOGPlus-Download-Checker/blob/master/GOGPlus_drop.png?raw=true)

A frontend program and GUI plus dropbox, that uses innoextract.exe (for EXE and associated BIN files) and 7z.exe (for ZIP and other archive type files) downloaded primarily from the GOG gaming store, but also other sources for the file types supported, as an attempt to check their integrity. Particularly useful for testing before archiving.

This is a partial replacement for the now disabled GOG Downloader, and to be used in that context with the browser downloads from the GOG site (user's game library), either with or without a third party downloading program. I use and recommend Free Download Manager 5.

Primary file types supported are - EXE (+ BIN), ZIP, 7Z, RAR, BZ2, GZ, PK4, MSI, SH, XZ, ISO, PDF.

See the Releases links for the v2.2 download.

See the file Notes.txt for my DISCLAIMER, and for links to required third party files and some instructions etc.
